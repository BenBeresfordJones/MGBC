# Additional data for MGBC pipelines

This directory includes additional datasets as required for some of the `src` pipelines. 

* `mgbc_rep_index_26640.tsv` and `uhgg_rep_index_100456.tsv` are example datasets for fulfilling the `$M_REPMEMS` and `$H_REPMEMS` variables from `3-build-species-pangenomes/get.pangenome_MGBC1094.sh`
* The `InterPro_DBs/` contains the IPR metadata needed for a couple of the analysis scripts from `4-functional-analyses/`
