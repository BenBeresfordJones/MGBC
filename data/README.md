# MMGC data files

These datasets are utilised by workflows in `src`:
  * `mouse-18075.tsv`: taxonomy data for the 18,075 non-redundant, near-complete genomes of the MMGC 
      * NOTE: this file utilises the original genome name instead of the standardised genome ID scheme
  * `human-100456.tsv`: taxonomy data for the 100,456 non-redundant, near-complete genomes of the UHGG


Data files that were too large to make available on GitHub have been deposited on Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.4305513](https://zenodo.org/record/4305513#.X8n6Li2cb_Q).
