# MMGC data files

These datasets are utilised by workflows in `src`:
  * `mouse-18075.tsv`: taxonomy data for the 18,075 non-redundant, near-complete genomes of the MMGC 
      * NOTE: this file utilises the original genome name instead of the standardised genome ID scheme
  * `human-100456.tsv`: taxonomy data for the 100,456 non-redundant, near-complete genomes of the UHGG
