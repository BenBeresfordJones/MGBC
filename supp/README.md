# Supplementary Data/Tables: Functional and taxonomic comparison of mouse and human gut microbiotas using extensive culturing and metagenomics. 

This file contains the supplementary tables referenced in the manuscript.
The first tab is an index with basic information on each figure.

More detailed information including explanations of the column headers are available on the top row of each tab.
		
### Summary:		

| Tab name	| Contents	| Description/Notes |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------- | 
| Supplementary Table 1	| Data for the genomes of the Mouse Culture Collection isolates.	| Data on the genomes of the 276 cultured isolates that consitute the MCC (288 total; 12 failed QC). Includes FTP download link. |
| Supplementary Table 2	| Metadata for the mouse gut shotgun metagenomes used in this study.	| Data for the 1927 metagenomes that passed QC - meaning they were of sufficient depth to allow MAG synthesis. |
| Supplementary Table 3	| QC data for the near-complete MAGs.	| Data for the 23,064 near-complete MAGs (with redundancy). |
| Supplementary Table 4	| Data for the non-redundant, near-complete genomes that were utilised in the majority of the analyses in this paper.	| Genome, QC, RNA, and taxonomy data are given, as well as FTP download links, for each of the 18,075 genomes. |
| Supplementary Table 5	| The average mouse microbiome.	| Summary statistics for each species in this study across the 1927 shotgun metagenomes. |
| Supplementary Table 6	| Shared species between humans and mice.	| Taxonomic breakdown of the species that can be found in the microbiotas of both humans and mice. |
| Supplementary Table 7	| Mouse colony data, including genotypes.	| Additional information on the mouse colonies that were sampled in order to build the mouse culture collection (MCC). |
| Supplementary Table 8	| Information on the agars used for culturing and the organisms that were cultured, identified using 16S.	| Agar names, and bacterial yields. | 
| Supplementary Table 9	| Non-redundant, near-complete genomes of the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) collection.	| 100,456 human-drived microbial genomes were compared with the MMGC. |
