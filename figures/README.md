## Scripts for figures

These .Rmd scripts contain the code to generate all the figures for the manuscript.
The relevant data files can be found in the `fig_data/` directory. 

Data files that were too large to make available on GitHub have been deposited on Zenodo: [10.5281/zenodo.4305513](https://zenodo.org/record/4305513#.X8n6Li2cb_Q).
