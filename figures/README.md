## Scripts for figures

These .Rmd scripts contain the code to generate most of the figures for the manuscript, the exceptions being the tree figures that were built using iToL.

As some datasets are too large to be hosted on GitHub, run the install_datasets.sh script to download the remaining files (~330Mb) and unzip the figure data.
```
./install_datasets.sh
```
